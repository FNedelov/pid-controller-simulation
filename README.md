# pid-controller-simulation
The folders contain a 2018 project that simulates a PID (proportional–integral–derivative) controller circuit

Folders contain:
- Designined and built the circuit, using optocoupler sensor, PC fan as actuator and NI USB-4431 as signal generator.
- Created PID control algorithm in LabView and in C#.
- Finished project that allows the user to use a WinForms app, in which the PID terms and the fan RPM can be freely modified. By changing the parameters, one can track the effects in real time, by watching a graph or the speed of the PC fan.
- Videos of the finished project in 'Fan_Circuit' folder.
